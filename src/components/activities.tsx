                Here we meet to discuss and talk about the latest ongoing
                research in this field. This is conducted weekly on Friday night
                of 2 hours long duration. Where interested students present a
                short talk on some latest articles which they found to be
                interesting to share. This helps significantly in developing and
                maintaining curiosity and in spreading the latest research among
                the campus. Have a look at our activities in the journal club
                here.

                We promote three types of projects:
                <br /> <strong>Replications of previous work:</strong>
                Whether the previous works are reproducible or not plays a great
                role specifically in experimental psychology. We try to target
                some of the most influential results of past research and check
                whether those results can be reproduced or not.
                <br /> <strong>Working on a new idea:</strong> We also support
                some of the projects on the latest ongoing research in our area
                of interest.
                <br /> <strong>Projects for Learning:</strong> Many of the
                projects are encouraged just for learning purposes. To provide
                support and guidance to students who donâ€™t have much experience
                and would like to jump into our area of interest.
