      The Brain and Cognitive Science Club (BCS @IITK) is a Science and Technology Club at IIT Kanpur. We aim at studying Brain Science to reverse engineer human intelligence to create more general and intelligent AIs for the future world. To achieve this we try to probe it from both ways i.e. developing better computational models of human cognition as well as relating the individual functionality of artificial computational models with that of humans. Our work is highly interdisciplinary and thrives at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational cognition.
